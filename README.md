# GitLab Push PoC
A proof of concept for GitLab based repository and pipeline that pushes
to a GitHub mirror.

Here's a change made in the before-protected-config branch to verify all branches are pushed to mirror, and to explore pull request and merge behavior.

Here's a change made in the after-protected-config branch to verify this branch isn't pushed to mirror.  After the PR is merged, this should show up in the mirror.
